#!/bin/bash -e

: <<'DOCS'
This script will execute a command when it detects low cpu activity for X intervals.

## Usage

### Install `idle_then` Script

```sh
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ddrscott/ddrscott/master/bin/idle_then | tee /usr/local/bin/idle_then
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/idle_then
```

### Schedule `idle_then` Script

```sh
crontab -e

# add the following line
* * * * * /usr/local/bin/idle_then /sbin/shutdown now
```

Any arguments passed to `idle_then` is the command executed idle is detected.

## Strategy

1. The script is scheduled for check for activity periodically via `crontab`.
2. If zero load exists, we append to a log file.
3. If zero load does NOT exist, we clear the log file. The machine is busy.
4. When the log file has too many lines, we execute $idle_cmd.

Therefore, anytime activity is detected, the idle timer is reset, and the
`idle_cmd` will never fire.

By scheduling every minute and setting $max_idle_lines to 15,
`$idle_cmd` will execute after 15 minutes of zero load activity.

All activity is logged to `/var/log/syslog` via `logger` command.

# What to do when max_idle_lines is reached
# Defaults to any arguments passed to the script.
# If no arguments are passed, then defaults to:
#     gcloud compute instance stop {current_instance}

# Max idle depends on how often the script is run.
# Once we accumulate `max_idle_lines` in the log file,
# we shutdown the system.
